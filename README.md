# PINKY's Catering and Dining

This project is inspired by my brothers love for cooking. His dishes are further inspired by our late mothers skill in cooking home cooked meals. He has taken what he learnt from my mother and added his own flair to venture a business in catering and dining.

This is a flegling business and I thought it appropriate to build him a website to be able to promote his services in the digial era we live in. The dishes shown here are from stock images representing the meals he makes.
