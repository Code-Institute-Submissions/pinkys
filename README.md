# PINKY's Catering and Dining

This is my first milestone project and it is inspired by my brothers love for cooking. His dishes are further inspired by our late mothers skill in cooking home cooked meals. He has taken what he has learned from my mother and added his own flair to venture a business in catering and dining, aptly named after our mothers nickname... Pinky.

This is a flegling business and I thought it appropriate to build him a website to be able to promote his services. The dishes shown here are from stock images representing the meals he makes and the data in the site is semi fictional, this includes images, testimonals and restaurant menu.

As mentioned the business is extremely small at the moment but I have decided to put in place a site that can be populated with his own material and data when he is ready for a full live domain.

## UX

The UX of the site is designed to be a clean and easy to navigate themed look. The site is static in line with what has been taught so far in this part of the course, HTML5 and CSS3. The idea is a user can instantly see the two main services provided (catering and dining) and browse through further to meet their needs. 

The UI colours we have chosen are pink, dark and light purples and whites and slightly off whites, I feel this pallette of colours completment each other and we wanted to have some sort of tone of pink in the site to reflect the brand name.

The site is made easy to navigate with the hamburger menu in mobile view clearly showing the available links and the menu bar clearly visible in desktop version too. (min-width: 600px).

## Features

### Home page:

Down the page the user is made aware of the CTA button to sign up to Pinky's restaurant deals and newsletters following on are two Learn More buttons for each sub category service on offer.

### Abous Us:

This page describes a breif history of how this business and company came to be with a sample pictur of cooked food and a sample video to show the process.

### Gallery:

The gallery page shows sample images of t dishes that have been made at events that would be similar to that of what Pinky's would offer. This page features a hover over where the image scales up slightly and has a pink glow background.

### Testimonials:

This page shows real testimonies from people that my brother has sold his cooking to, with the exception of the pictures, these are stock photos added in to show case the skills I have learned and wanted to demonstrate in this section.

### Contact Us:

Contact us page is a simple Bootstrap 4 form that has been places over a hero image and styled to meet the theme look and feel.

 
### Existing Features

* CTA buttons on home page allows users to easily sign up to discount offers, news letters and deals. as well as submit custom information and dates for catering services if there were a back end set up to recieve this.

* Order and Book now buttons which currently link to nothing but would go through to a order menu type form on which customers could place orders or book time slots for food delivaries.

* Social media icon buttons in footer designed to be visible and to guide users to social media site and increase traffic and following.

* Embedded video on about page showing example process of cooking work.

* Simple Bootstrap 4 contact form embedded over a hero image.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Booking system allowing for a user to go through to a UI that lets them place and book orders for delivery, this would be accessed via the links on the home page called "Order now" and "Book Now", which currently link to nothing. It is simply because of time restrictions I have no coded this kind of UI as my main focus was to build the main site and its functionality. 

- Sign Up button impletmentation to allow users that sign up to Pinky's to actually recieve Discounts, news about the company and other offers.

- Contact us page with smaps API to allow users to know where Pinky's is located and the local area of distrubtion.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
    - This project used **HTML5** to implement semantic web design markup.
- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)
    - I have used **CSS3** for styling the site and because of CSS3 features like flexbox and grid.
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/)
    - There has been some use of **Bootstrap 4** for things like navigation menus collapse/toggle.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - I have used minimal **jQuery** for bootstrap 4 navbar animation.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - **Font Awesome** has been used for social media icons. I used **Font Awesome** because it provides clean professional looking icons.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - **Google fonts** has been used to style text through out the site, I have used **Google Fonts** because it provides a vast choice of font styles aside from the default available. 


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
